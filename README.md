# time-series-forecasting
#Project Overview

This project is a solution for the Store Sales – Time Series Forecasting competition hosted by Kaggle.
The objective is to accurately forecast daily sales for thousands of product families across different grocery stores in Ecuador, owned by Corporación Favorita.

Through this project, I explored real-world time series forecasting challenges using machine learning techniques such as feature engineering,
lag/rolling statistics, and LightGBM modeling. The final predictions are evaluated using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).
